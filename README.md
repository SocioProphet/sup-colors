# Sup colorschemes

This is a collection of sup colorschemes created by users of sup. Enter the
subdirectory of each theme for more information and screenshots (if
available).

If you have created your own colorscheme either submit it directly or set up a
repository modelled after e.g. the wombat colorscheme and we can include it as
a submodule in this repository.

Please refer to [Customizing colors](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/sup/wiki/Customizing-colors) in the wiki for information on how to use the
colorscheme or how to customize your own.
